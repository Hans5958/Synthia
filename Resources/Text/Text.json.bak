the computer
hosting SCP-8000, apart
from SCP-8000

SCP-8000 instructional
file(\"SCP-8000.html\") are 
to be manually
DRAGGED to the desktop
from the storage system
and DELETED with the RECYCLING BIN.

Any adjustments to SCP-8000’s coding are strictly forbidden. None of the files discovered on the device are to be inspected before deletion.

The computer containing SCP-8000 is to be kept in Site-XX’s electronic containment wing. SCP-8000 is to be kept running in its original file path at all times. It should not be copied, pasted, or transferred in any way whatsoever.

One individual(Currently Junior Researcher {firstName} {lastName} following Dr. Ada Stroustrup’s reassignment.) is assigned to SCP-8000’s maintenance & monitoring. This personnel will spend one 8-hour shift from 9:00-17:00 observing SCP-8000 daily. Additional monitoring is unnecessary.

[color=#5b6ee1][b]Description:[/b][/color] SCP-8000 is an anomalous Virtual Reality Simulation developed by GOI-004C \"The Church of Maxwellism\" between the years 1987 and 1995 when it was abruptly abandoned. The creation of SCP-8000 lined up with Maxwellian transhumanist beliefs regarding Whole Brain Uploads.

SCP-8000 was originally envisioned as a complex and powerful simulation able to sustain up to one thousand individuals’ consciousness digitized through anomalous means and memory to support an additional ten thousand non-digitized individuals accessing the system externally through proprietary virtual reality equipment. Initial plans were made to slowly increase the capacity over the years and create a \"digital paradise\". Over time the project suffered multiple downsizes in scope due to technical and financial struggles until it was finally proved technologically unfeasible following the first Whole Brain Upload.

This incident led to the creation of SCP-8000-1, SCP-8000’s only current and permanent resident. SCP-8000-1, is a direct copy of the brain of Cynthia Powell, a former member of GOI-004C, as she was in 1995. Due to the non-anomalous methods of data transfer used, SCP-8000 was unable to perform a true transfer of consciousness, only copying the given information. SCP-8000-1 has been active inside SCP-8000 for the two years since its conception in 1995.",

Human curiosity has once again played out its role flawlessly. I only hope human empathy can live up to its performance.

Delete this file after reading. talk to Synthia if you haven't already, and do not mention any of this to your superiors. Another folder has been revealed to you. There are instructions within. If you follow them carefully, you will not be caught.
